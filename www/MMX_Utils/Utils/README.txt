## THIS FILE CONTAINS A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE VARIOUS CODE SNIPPETS USED IN MMX UTILITIES ##
###############################################################################################

The following folder has the following files:

1. Adstock_decay_utility_functions: This file has multiple functions to create, evaluate and use models along with functions to create, visualize and use adstocks. It also had functions written for getting decay values, contributions and applying adstock transformation on each of the spend variables.

Dependencies of this file in other modules:
A. mmx simulation and optimization tool (server.R)
B. market mix model (Carry-over and Saturation effects notebook)
C. MMx modelling notebook (log-log, semi-log, frac-root, GAM)

2.  Contrib_marg_utility_functions: This file constains utilities for calculating contributions and maringal effects for marketing mix models. It helps you view and use these contributions and marginal effects also. One of the methods for calculating contributions in the Mean Value Theorem method.

Dependencies of this file in other modules:
A. mmx simulation and optimization tool (server.R)
B. MMX : Contributions and Marginals Notebook
C. MMx: Carry-over and Saturation effects notebook
D. MMx modelling notebook (log-log, semi-log, frac-root, GAM)

3. CustomPrecision: This file contains functions to help you handle precision for numeric data frame displays.

Dependencies of this file in other modules:
A. mmx simulation and optimization tool (server.R)

4. Optimization_utils: This file has functions that can help you create models and create optimization modules like Particle Swarm Optimization. It also has functions to run optimizations.
